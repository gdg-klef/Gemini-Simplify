## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+** is required.
2. A **Google API Key** for the Generative AI model.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gdg-klef-Gemini-Simplify.git
   cd gdg-klef-Gemini-Simplify
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
     ```
   - Replace `your_google_api_key` with your actual API key.

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. **Access the app**
   - Open the URL shown in the terminal (default: http://localhost:8501).

  - Double-check your `.env` file for correct formatting.
- If dependencies are missing, re-run:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
